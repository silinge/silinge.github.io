A selfie video of a travel blogger exploring a bustling Tokyo street market. She’s wearing a vintage denim jacket and has excitement in her eyes. The afternoon sun creates beautiful shadows between the vendor stalls. She’s sampling different street foods while talking, occasionally looking into the camera before turning to point at interesting stalls. The image is slightly grainy, looks very film-like. She speaks in a British accent and says: “Okay, you have to try this place when you visit Tokyo. The takoyaki here is absolutely incredible, and the vendor just told me it’s been in his family for three generations.” She ends with a thumbs up.
